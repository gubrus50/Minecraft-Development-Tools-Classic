## WHAT IS Minecraft-DT?
Minecraft-DT is a simple launcher for special development tools. Development tools are basically a third party editors based on game known as [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/). Those editors allow the user to save their time by taking part in complex tasks. Take one of our tools as an example: [Command Creation Generator](https://github.com/gubrus50/Minecraft-Development-Tools-Classic/releases/tag/CCG-v0.1.2) or go to [Downloads section](https://github.com/gubrus50/Minecraft-Development-Tools-Classic#downloads).
