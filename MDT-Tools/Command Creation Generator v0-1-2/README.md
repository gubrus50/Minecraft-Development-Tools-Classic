<p>
Command Creation Generator is a simple tool which generates Minecraft Creations. This tool gives ability to save and open the creations progress. It also provides the user with two editors, The Sign Editor and The Container Editor.<br />

Sign editor allows the user to create an interactive menu for the creation container.
Container editor allows the user to append their own algorithm to the creation container commands.

## WHAT IS Command Creation?
Command creation is a smart container that stores many [``command blocks``](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block). Most of the modern command creations usually contain a user friendly interface that allows the user to toggle "On" and/or "Off" the commands that are within the container. Once activated, those command blocks will run a series of complex algorithm.

Command creations are usually summoned by one or more command blocks. They are found to be useful as they can be easily and quickly exported to the world. This means that you don't have to download a complete new world or a schematic to use them.
